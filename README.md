# Basic-Blockchain
A basic blockchain build in python, create a crypto currency and then do ICO

In the block chain python file a flask application is created where blockchain protocol concepts are implemented like creating block, implementing proof of work, checking if a chain is valid, choosing the longest chain, adding transactiong and node. To access the blockchain multiple GET and POST REST endpoints are created. The endpoints are there for mining block for miners, getting chain, adding transaction, connecting nodes and replacing chain

For the second part a very basic solidity contract is written with function where investor can buy and sell coins for usd based on conversion rate. The contact was deployed and basic function were performed using Ganache and EtherWallet.

# My Original Contribution & Learnings

Contribution =>
None, reimplemented this by taking reference from various online articles and educational video.

Major Learnings => 
Learnt how blockchain works by building a flask application which builds basic block chain functionality creating block, implementing proof of work, checking for valid chain etc.
Learnt how to build smart contract in solidity where user can exchange usd for tokens as happens in ico.
